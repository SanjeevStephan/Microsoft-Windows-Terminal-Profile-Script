```
I have a directory named "auto" located in the location C:\Users\Samst\OneDrive\Documents\PowerShell\profile\auto" which contains some  powershel  ps1 files which i want to execute it without having to know the name of the ps1 file. so i have already setup my terminal in the powershell version 7.4.1 when ever i open the terminal i loads the "Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1" script where i want to put a auto-discovery script code to autoamaticaly execute all the files in the  "auto" directory. write me a concise code for that and comment to help me undestand it better
