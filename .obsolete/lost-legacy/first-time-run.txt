====================================================
Tools for Node.js Native Modules Installation Script
====================================================

This script will install Python and the Visual Studio Build Tools, necessary
to compile Node.js native modules. Note that Chocolatey and required Windows
updates will also be installed.

This will require about 3 GiB of free disk space, plus any space necessary to
install Windows updates. This will take a while to run.

Please close all open programs for the duration of the installation. If the
installation fails, please ensure Windows is fully updated, reboot your
computer and try to run this again. This script can be found in the
Start menu under Node.js.

You can close this window to stop now. Detailed instructions to install these
tools manually are available at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows
