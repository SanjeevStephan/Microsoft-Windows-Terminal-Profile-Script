Certainly! To read a JSON file in PowerShell and display it as a table, follow these steps:

1. **Read the JSON File**:
    
    - Use the `Get-Content` cmdlet to retrieve the content of your JSON file.
    - Pipe the content to `ConvertFrom-Json` to parse it into a PowerShell object.
2. **Access the Data**:
    
    - Once you have the JSON content as a PowerShell object, you can access its properties and values.
    - For example, if your JSON structure has an array of environments with variables, you can access them like this:

```powershell
# Read JSON from a file (replace 'file.json' with your actual file path)
$jsonContent = Get-Content -Path 'file.json' -Raw
$environments = $jsonContent | ConvertFrom-Json

# Accessing variables for a specific environment (e.g., 'Staging')
$stagingVariables = $environments.environments | Where-Object { $_.name -eq 'Staging' } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty variables

# Display the variables as a table
$stagingVariables | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

3. **Customize Output**:
    - Modify the code above to suit your specific JSON structure and requirements.
    - You can adjust the property names and formatting as needed.

Remember to replace `'file.json'` with the actual path to your JSON file. This example assumes that your JSON contains an array of environments with variables. [Adjust the code accordingly based on your JSON structure](https://powershellfaqs.com/read-json-file-into-array-in-powershell/)[1](https://powershellfaqs.com/read-json-file-into-array-in-powershell/)[2](https://www.pandas.dev/mastering-json-parsing-in-powershell-a-comprehensive-guide/).
